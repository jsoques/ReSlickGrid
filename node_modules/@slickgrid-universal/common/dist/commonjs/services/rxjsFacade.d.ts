 * The developer who will want to use RxJS will simply have to use the extra `rxjs-observable` package to get going.
 *
 * That external `rsjs-observable` package simply implements this RxJsFacade
 * and is just a very simple and basic RxJS Wrapper package (which will depend on the real RxJS package)
